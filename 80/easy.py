As all of us who have read "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
knows, the reason He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named chose his creepy moniker
is that "I Am Lord Voldemort" is an anagram for his birthname, "Tom
Marvolo Riddle".

I've never been good at these kinds of word-games (like anagrams),
I always find it hard to figure out that stuff manually. I find it
much more enjoyable to write computer programs to solve these
problems for me. In the spirit of that, today's problem is to find
simple one-word anagrams for other words.

Write a program that given a word will find all one-word anagrams
for that word. So, for instance, if you put in "LEPROUS", it should
return "PELORUS" and "SPORULE". As a dictionary, use [this
file](http://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt),
which is a 1.8 mb text-file with one word listed on each line, each
word listed in lower-case. In this problem description, I've used
upper-case for all words and their anagrams, but that is entirely
optional, it's perfectly all right to use lower-case if you want
to.

Using your program, find all the one-word anagrams for "TRIANGLE".

* * *

(by the way, in case anyone is curious: a "PELORUS" is "a sighting
device on a ship for taking the relative bearings of a distant
object", which I imagine basically is a telescope bolted onto a
compass, and a "SPORULE" is "a small spore")

* * *

Bonus: if you looked up the anagrams for "PAGERS", you'd find that
there was actually quite a few of them: "GAPERS", "GASPER", "GRAPES",
"PARGES" and "SPARGE". Those five words plus "PAGERS" make a six-word
"anagram family".

Here's another example of an anagram family, this time with five
words: "AMBLERS", "BLAMERS", "LAMBERS", "MARBLES" and "RAMBLES".

What is the largest anagram family in the dictionary I supplied?
What is the second largest?
